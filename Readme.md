# Log.js

Lightweight logging for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org). Includes a streaming log reader.


## Installation

```bash
$ npm install log
```
## Log Levels

 Mirror that of syslog:
 
  - `0` `EMERGENCY`   system unusable
  - `1` `ALERT`       immediate action required
  - `2` `CRITICAL`    condition critical
  - `3` `ERROR`       condition error
  - `4` `WARNING`     condition warning
  - `5` `NOTICE`      condition normal, but significant 
  - `6` `INFO`        a purely informational message
  - `7` `DEBUG`       debugging information

## Example

By default, a Log’s stream is `stdout`, and its log level defaults is `DEBUG`. 

Instead of `DEBUG`,  let’s create a log with the `info` level.  This means that erorrs sent with a level lower than info will not be sent to the output stream:

```javascript
var Log = require('log')
  , log = new Log('info');

log.debug('preparing email'); //this will not appear, since debug is a lower log level than "info" 
log.info('sending email');
log.error('failed to send email');
```

Specifying a specific stream:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs')
 , Log = require('log')
 , log = new Log('debug', fs.createWriteStream('my.log'));
```

Instead of the log level constants, you can just supply a string:

```javascript
var Log = require('log')
  , log = new Log('warning');
```
 
You can use `%s` to pass arguments (much like `console.log()`):
 
```javascript
log.error('oh no, failed to send mail to %s.', user.email);
```


## Reader

To stream a log, simply pass a readable stream instead of a writable:

```javascript
var Log    = require('log')
  , fs     = require('fs')
  , stream = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/file.log')
  , log    = new Log('debug', stream);

log.on('line', function(line){
  console.log(line);
});
```

(**Note:** `log.js` assumes utf8 encoded data.)

Example output:

```javascript
{ date: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 01:26:14 GMT
, level: 1
, levelString: 'ALERT'
, msg: 'a alert message'
}
{ date: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 01:26:14 GMT
, level: 0
, levelString: 'EMERGENCY'
, msg: 'a emergency message'
}
```
